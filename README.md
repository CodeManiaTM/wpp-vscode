# W++ VSCode visual mod

> see [the other repo](https://github.com/CodeManiaTM/wpp) for more information about W++

A sort of mod/hack to visualize it within VSCode, to Program W++ as intended.

----

## How to use

1. Copy paste the code (`naive-impelementation.js`) in dev tools console, you find it under `help` > `toggle developer tools`.
2. It may not work upon initial opening of files, but `double-clicking` in either file explorer or tabs seems to resolve it.
3. Stop it by running the function logged to the console by `right-clicking` > `store function as global variable` and then call it like `temp1();` (after switching tabs it should revert).

these instructions are also at the top of `naive-implementation.js`
